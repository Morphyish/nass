# Svelte

# Compiler

as a Framework

# More code, More problems

Svelte is a tool for your mind, not your code

# Reactive statements

```
$: updateWhen(thisChange)
```

# Stores

and even more fully optional modules !

# Drawbacks

* Small ecosystem/community
* No (official) devtools
* Very little IDE support
* No Typescript support
